This is modified and expanded from a code-along project from a Udemy course implemented a basic React front end for a shopping cart.

The original project was written in JS, I have implemented in TS. Once completed I may also expand features/backend or use as a template for a production ECommerce implementation of my own.

master branch has the basic front end set up
with-react-redux branch has an implementation using redux and with a back end for stripe payments

npm-start to run in dev for master branch


npm run dev to run in dev for redux implementation
