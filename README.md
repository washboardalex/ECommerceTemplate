This is modified and expanded from a code-along project from a Udemy course implemented a basic React front end for a shopping cart.

The original project was written in JS, I have implemented in TS. Once completed I may also expand features/backend or use as a template for a production ECommerce implementation of my own.

npm start to begin project.
